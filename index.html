        <ul>
            <li>For reading/eBook activities, when clicking on the link to the textbook, this now automatically opens in a new window meaning the course stays open. Once learners have finished and close their reading, a button has been added on the original course (that has stayed open), which allows them to click and return to course page/activity quickly. A quick link has also been added in the quicklinks menu which says return to course. This will improve navigation for learners.</li>
            <li>For assessment course, improvements have been made so that when clicking on the assessment focus icon in their unit course, that the assessment course now opens automatically in a new window, leaving the unit course open so they can move easily between the windows and the two courses. There is also a back to the unit tab button which they can click to bring up all tabs of their course to improve navigation both between courses and within the course.</li>
